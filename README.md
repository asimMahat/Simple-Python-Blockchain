# Simple-Python-Blockchain
A simple blockchain in python.


I hope you have the basic ideas about blockchain before starting this.
I have created a class named "block" in "python_block.py" where the attributes are the hash value of previous block,datas in the blockchain and the timestamp.In class 'block' the function  get_hash() is used to get the unique hash value for specific block.Similarly,the static function genesis_block()is used to create the first block in the Blockchain often called "Genesis Block".

In "block_chain.py" class "block" is called and we have computed the output for first 10 blocks in the blockchain. The number of blocks in the blockchain can be altered. Its just the basic outline of how a simple blockchain can be created using python with some dependencies.Here no transaction is performed.
